# asdf-xcode

An asdf plugin for Xcode

Oftentimes, it's important to tie a project to a specific version of Xcode. It may also be useful to have asdf manage your Xcode versions automatically, when shifting between repositories. This plugin is intended to integrate xcode-select and data from <xcodereleases.com> to enable asdf support for Xcode. 

Note: This plugin will only function on macOS.
